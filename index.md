DVM MSc. PhD student - Ruminant nutrition

About me:

I am a PhD student at Penn State University with a bachelor’s degree in Veterinary Medicine (2017) and a M.Sc. in Veterinary Sciences (2019) from Federal University of Uberlandia, Brazil. I have a background in ruminant nutrition and production, with an emphasis in dairy sciences. As a researcher in Brazil, I have been involved in more than 8 research projects related to the dairy cattle nutrition and production, with some of them being sponsored by different companies such as Cargill, AB vista Dow Agrosciences, Phibro, and Alta Genetics. In the US, I was a visiting scholar in the Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences at Purdue University (2020-21) where I did research related to the metabolism and nutrition of transition dairy cows. I was also a research assistant in the Department of Animal Sciences at The Pennsylvania State University (2021) where I did research related to sustainable dairy nutrition. From these projects I authored and co-authored 5 books, 1 book chapter, 3 peer reviewed publication at the Journal of Dairy Science and Livestock Science, as well as several abstracts. I have been recently elected to serve on the board for the ASAS Northeast Section/ADSA Northeast Branch as a Graduate Director (2023). I have also been involved in farm operations, working as a herdsman at the research farm of the Federal University of Uberlandia and at the Purdue Dairy Research Center, as a CEO of a junior consulting company, and as a consultant myself in dairy farms, which allowed me to deepen my knowledge of the daily operations of farms, including all the steps involving animal nutrition, management and health, forage production, and financial planning. Currently, my main focus is on sustainable dairy nutrition for efficient milk production. During my PhD program I am investigating how fuels from the diet can affect the rumen metabolism and how we can better formulate diets to reduce the waste of nutrients while maintaining milk production and composition through the application of precision feeding strategies. My goal is to become a professor of dairy nutrition and to contribute with the advance of the dairy sciences.
